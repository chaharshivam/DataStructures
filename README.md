# DataStructures
This repository is aimed at explaining the concepts of Data Structures in a fun way. Although, Data Structures is more about understanding the concept; however, I hope to provide the implementation in various programming languages so that no one feels left out. you are welcome to contribute :)

Folder Structure: **[DS]/[Language]/file**

E.g.
* **LinkedList/C++/file.cpp**

Note : The file should contain comments explaining the code and also the concept.
