#Data Structures
##Introduction
*Data Structures is the fundamental concept of computer science. Good knowledge of Data Structures is a must to design efficient software.*

*We deal with data all the time and how we organize our data matters.* 
**e.g.** 
>We are able to search for a word efficiently and quickly in a **Dictionary** because all the words are sorted but imagine if the words weren't sorted, it would be laborious to find what we're looking for.

*Another example is a* 
>**Map** which has data, like position of a landmark or road network connections organized in the form of geometries. So, map needs to be structured in such a way that we are able to search for landmarks and routes.

*Another simple example would be a* 
>**Cash Book** that has data in tabular form which makes it easier to group data and extract information.

*Different kind of structures are needed for different kind of data, if we do not use the right kind of structures then our softwares will not be efficient. So,*

>**Data structure is a way to store data such that it can be used efficiently.**

*When we study data structures we just define their abstract view* 
**e.g** 
>T.V. is an electronic device that can be turned on/off, it recieves signals and it supports audio/video. This is an abstract view that gives us a basic idea about T.V.

*Similarly, We define data structures as 'Abstract Data Types (or ADTs)'. Now, Let's define an abstract view for **List** ADT.* 

*So, it should be able to:*

* Store a given number of elements of any type
* Read elements by position
* Modify element at a particular position

*This gives us a fair idea of how we need to structure the data inside a **List** ADT. Once we have a basic idea, we can implement it in any language of our choice.*
