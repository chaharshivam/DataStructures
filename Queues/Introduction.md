# Queues
### Introduction

Just like Linked list or Stack, Queue is another data structure used to store data. Queues are
also known as **FIFO** (First-in First-out) data structure.

*If you have ever waited hours just to get that movie ticket, and wished that only if you had come a little earlier just so you wouldn't have to wait too long, you already understand how 
queues work. i.e. The order of arrival is important, and in this case first element gets served first. The insertion is done at the rear and elements are removed from the front.*

While dealing with the **Queues** we have two things to care about:
* Data
* Pointer to the later element

#### Properties Of Queues:
* It is an ordered list
* Known as FIFO data structure

#### Operations:
* Insert an element i.e. Enqueue
* Remove an element i.e. Dequeue
* Return the first element i.e peek
* Size of Queue
* Check if Queue is empty or full

#### Why Queues?
Queues are used when we have to perform scheduling tasks e.g.

* In Operating systems, jobs are scheduled according to their order of arrival.
* Call center phone systems keep use Queues to keep callers on hold.
* Simulating real-world queues such as ticket counter.
