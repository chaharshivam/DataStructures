# Linked List
### Introduction

Just like a list, linked list is another data structure but the elements (or nodes) are connected with the help of pointers. Let's dive
into the explanation now..

*Imagine we have **n** pieces of paper that are marked from **1 to n** and we are allowed to write data on it.*
*Now, we mix up all the pieces and ask you to arrange them in a sequence. So, how would you go about it? yes, we can use the pre-marked numbers*
*to arrange them in a sequence to make a list.*

*The whole point here is that the pieces are individual elements that have some data and they are linked with the help of pre-marked numbers*
*(or pointers).*
*Similarly, Linked list is a collection of nodes with each node pointing to the next one and that's how linked list comes into being.*

While dealing with **Linked list** we have two things to care about:
* data
* pointer to the next node

This abstract structure is known as a **node**.

#### Properties of a linked list:
* Elements are connected by pointers
* Last element points to **NULL**
* Dynamic in nature

> Note : The first node is known as **head**

#### Operations:
* Insert an element
* Delete an element
